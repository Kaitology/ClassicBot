        <h2>ClassicBot</h2>
        <p>ClassicBot was designed to enhance Classic World of Warcraft communities by allowing them to link directly to
            in game
            tooltips in their discord servers. Now when you get the final piece to craft "Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros",
            but no one is
            online to see your achievement you can link the item straight into discord so that as many eyes as possible
            can see the
            item in all its wonderful glory.</p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>ClassicBot functionality is pretty straight forward, you input a command and get responses back depending on
            the input.

            Current Commands:

            !item <i>item name</i> - Requests the tooltip of the supplied item name
            !ability <i>ability name</i> - Requests the tooltip of the max rank version, if ranked, of the supplied
            ability name</p>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>!item <i>sulfuras, hand of ragnaros</i>

            Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros

            !ability <i>frostbolt</i>

            Frostbolt
        </p>
        <h3>Feature Requests</h3>
        <p>Please direct all feature requests to the issues section of this repository, or click here.</p>

        <h3>Roadmap</h3>
        <p>There are a lot of features that I would still like to have be a part of this bot. Many of the pieces and
            parts of this
            bot rely on outside sources and so I am restricted to what these sources provide.

            <b>Future features include, but are not limited to:</b>

            Allowing specific ranks of abilities to be queried by users.
            Allowing talents, and their ranks to be queried by users.
            Replace command specific queries with a dynamic "build your own" style.
            !classic <b>weapon</b> <i>nightfall</i>
            !classic <b>spell</b> <i>rain of fire</i> rank 1
        </p>
        <h3>Contribution</h3>
        <p>Contribution information will be added once an official v1.0.0 of ClassicBot is released.
